the so_long project, using the codam MLX42

you need homebrew/42homebrew, glfw and cmake for this project.
if you don't have them, make will check if you have them and install them for you.

everything should work with a simple make, if some dependencies aren't installed, the compilation may take a few minutes, this is due to brew being slow.
